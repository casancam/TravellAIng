## TravellAIng

This project consists of an admin dashboard where users can see stats about their trips, total number of users and create trip itineraries using GeminiAPI following a series of selections.

When on the project feel free to log in with Google and access the dashboard to start creating trips using AI, there is no public-user view, it's just an Admin Dashboard
